# Knick Knack

Knick Knack is a macOS desktop application that utilizes Apple's Object Capture API to create 3D models from a folder of images. By providing 
the application with 30-200 quality images, the user is provided with an accurate 3D model within minutes. This application was created 
using SwiftUI, and artwork was created using Procreate.
